# SimAgentPlg

[English](README.md) | [简体中文](README_zh-CN.md)

SimAgentPlg is a lightweight core for building stateful, extensible agents on
OpenAI-compatible model APIs. It provides the runtime mechanism—state,
orchestration, context construction, tool dispatch, middleware, MCP, and
skills—while derived agents own concrete tools such as shell, file editing,
Git, or explicit completion.

Requires Python 3.12 or newer.

## Core capabilities

- Stateful `BaseAgent` with persistent conversation history and `reset()`
- Provider-neutral `ModelAdapter` boundary with an OpenAI-compatible adapter
- Public `AgentOrchestrator` for the provider-tool loop
- Structured `AgentRunResult`, `RunStatus`, and `StopReason`
- Explicit `RuntimePolicy` for loop and completion behavior
- `AgentContextBuilder` for non-mutating per-turn context projection
- Composable `BaseHandler` and `MethodToolHandler` tool contracts
- `ToolRuntime` lifecycle, routing, middleware, and repeat-call protection
- Generic `ToolMiddleware` interception
- Structured, cancellable Tool Progress events
- Provider-neutral token Usage and per-run budget guards
- Context pressure estimates, independent window budgets, and non-mutating
  compaction preparation
- Explicit, cancellable compaction through a pluggable `Compactor`, canonical
  `SummaryEntry`, and resumable Session snapshots
- Opt-in automatic compaction on context pressure and one safe recovery attempt
  for provider-normalized context overflow
- Versioned Session serialization, append-only JSONL journals, and explicit
  cross-process restoration
- Optional MCP integration through `McpToolHandler`
- Local skill discovery, metadata projection, and explicit context activation

The core intentionally does not provide Bash, Git, filesystem, approval UI, or
finish tools. Those belong to a derived agent such as a CodeAgent.

This core-boundary change removes the former `BashHandler`, `GitDiffHandler`,
`FinishHandler`, `HumanApproval`, and `BashApprovalMiddleware` public exports.
Derived agents should provide equivalent implementations when needed.

## Installation

```bash
uv sync
```

MCP support is optional. Install its extra only when the agent uses MCP:

```bash
uv sync --extra mcp
# or: pip install "SimAgentPlg[mcp]"
```

## Configuration

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and provide model credentials:

```env
MODEL_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxxx
MODEL_URL=https://api.deepseek.com
CHAT_MODEL=deepseek-v4-flash
LLM_TIMEOUT=60
LLM_TEMPERATURE=0.7
LLM_INCLUDE_USAGE=true
```

`ModelConfig` belongs to `OpenAIModelAdapter`, rather than to `BaseAgent`.
Configuration can also be supplied directly:

```python
from simagentplg import ModelConfig

config = ModelConfig(
    model="deepseek-v4-flash",
    api_key="sk-xxxxxxxx",
    base_url="https://api.deepseek.com",
)
```

Other model providers can integrate with the core by implementing
`ModelAdapter.complete()` and optionally overriding `ModelAdapter.stream()`.
The adapter owns provider client creation, response normalization, streaming,
and optional startup/shutdown resources; `BaseAgent` only consumes
provider-neutral stream events and the normalized `AssistantMessage` contract.

## Plain agent

Conversation history is preserved across calls:

```python
from simagentplg import BaseAgent, ModelConfig, OpenAIModelAdapter

agent = BaseAgent(
    OpenAIModelAdapter(ModelConfig.from_env()),
    agent_id="tutor",
    system_prompt="You are a concise Python tutor.",
)

first = await agent.runtime(task="Remember that I prefer Python.")
second = await agent.runtime(task="Which language do I prefer?")

agent.reset()
await agent.shutdown()
```

Calls on the same agent are serialized to protect conversation state.

## Structured runs

`run()` exposes the core result protocol:

```python
result = await agent.run(task="Explain the repository architecture.")

print(result.status)
print(result.stop_reason)
print(result.turns)
print(result.output)
```

`runtime()` remains a compatibility wrapper. It returns `result.output` for a
completed run and raises `AgentRunError` for failed, rejected, or cancelled
runs.

### Cancelling a run

Each run owns an independent cancellation token. `abort()` requests
cancellation without waiting, while `wait_for_idle()` settles only after the
terminal event and all awaited event sinks have completed:

```python
import asyncio

run = asyncio.create_task(agent.run(task="Perform a long operation."))

agent.abort("stopped by user")
await agent.wait_for_idle()
result = await run
```

An externally aborted run returns `RunStatus.CANCELLED` with
`StopReason.EXTERNAL_ABORT`. The same agent can be reused for another run.
Model adapters, tool middleware, and tool handlers receive the run's
`CancellationToken`; long-running handlers should also use `try/finally` to
release resources such as subprocesses.

### Streaming responses

`BaseAgent.run()` still returns one final `AgentRunResult`, while provisional
text and provisional reasoning are observed through typed Delta events:

```python
from simagentplg import AssistantThinkingDelta, AssistantTextDelta


class ConsoleSink:
    async def emit(self, event):
        if isinstance(event.payload, AssistantThinkingDelta):
            print("[thinking]", event.payload.delta, end="")
        elif isinstance(event.payload, AssistantTextDelta):
            print(event.payload.delta, end="", flush=True)
```

`OpenAIModelAdapter` uses a real streaming request. Tool-call fragments are
assembled inside the provider adapter and only complete `AssistantMessage`
objects enter Agent state. Thinking Delta remains observation-only and is not
mixed into normal text or persisted to Session. Existing complete-only adapters
remain compatible through the default `ModelAdapter.stream()` implementation.
Session recording ignores provisional deltas and persists only
`MessageCompleted`.

### Usage and run budgets

`ModelResponseCompleted` carries optional provider-neutral `ModelUsage`.
Reported Usage is attached to internal agent messages and Session history, but
`AgentContextBuilder` removes it from the final `llm_messages` sent to the
Provider. `AgentRunResult.usage` aggregates all attempted requests while
preserving whether every request actually reported Usage:

```python
result = await agent.run(task="Inspect the project.")

print(result.usage.total_tokens)
print(result.usage.request_count)
print(result.usage.complete)
```

Unknown Usage is distinct from zero. Complete-only adapters remain compatible
and produce an incomplete `RunUsage` unless they override `stream()` with a
terminal Usage value.

### Context pressure and compaction preparation

Context window capacity is independent of cumulative run spend. Configure an
optional `CompactionPolicy` to assess the complete provider request before each
model call:

```python
from simagentplg import CompactionPolicy, ContextBudget

context_policy = CompactionPolicy(
    ContextBudget(
        context_window=128_000,
        reserve_tokens=16_000,
        keep_recent_tokens=20_000,
    )
)

agent = BaseAgent(
    model,
    agent_id="context-aware",
    compaction_policy=context_policy,
)
```

The estimate combines the latest assistant `ModelUsage`, trailing messages,
and a UTF-8-aware heuristic lower bound that includes current tool schemas.
Each configured turn emits `ContextPressureEvaluated`. When the threshold is
reached, its `CompactionPreparation` separates protected messages, complete
old User/Assistant/Tool turns to summarize, and recent turns to keep. Tool
calls and results remain in the same turn.

`CompactionPolicy` alone remains observation-only. Applications can call
`estimate_context_usage()` and `prepare_compaction()` directly, and can replace
the fallback through `MessageTokenEstimator`.

### Automatic compaction and overflow recovery

Automatic behavior is opt-in and reuses the same `CompactionPolicy` and
`Compactor`:

```python
from simagentplg import AutoCompactionPolicy

agent = BaseAgent(
    model,
    agent_id="context-aware",
    compaction_policy=context_policy,
    compactor=my_compactor,
    auto_compaction_policy=AutoCompactionPolicy(),
)
```

At the configured pressure threshold, Core compacts old complete turns,
rebuilds context, and dispatches the model request in the same Agent Run. If a
provider adapter raises `ContextOverflowError`, Core can compact, rebuild, and
retry once. A second overflow returns `StopReason.CONTEXT_OVERFLOW`; compactor
failure returns `StopReason.COMPACTION_FAILED`. Core never retries after text or
thinking deltas have been exposed, preventing duplicate provisional output.

`AutoCompactionPolicy(compact_on_pressure=False)` keeps overflow recovery while
disabling proactive compaction. Set `enabled=False` or omit the policy to keep
all automatic behavior off. Provider adapters normalize overflow, rate-limit,
timeout, authentication, and other failures through `ModelProviderError` and
`ModelErrorKind`.

### Explicit compaction

A derived agent supplies the summary behavior through the cancellable
`Compactor` protocol, then invokes `compact()` explicitly:

```python
agent = BaseAgent(
    model,
    agent_id="context-aware",
    compaction_policy=context_policy,
    compactor=my_compactor,
)

compaction = await agent.compact()
print(compaction.status)
print(compaction.summary)
```

`ModelCompactor` adapts a borrowed `ModelAdapter` into this protocol while the
application still owns the summary prompt:

```python
compactor = ModelCompactor(
    summary_model,
    context_builder=build_summary_context,
    source="summary-model:v1",
)
```

The injected builder receives `CompactionRequest` and returns the complete
`ContextBuildResult`. The caller owns the borrowed model lifecycle, so Core
does not silently create another provider client or choose a prompt.

The Core calls the Compactor with `CompactionRequest`, creates trusted range and
token metadata in `SummaryEntry`, then atomically installs protected messages +
Summary + recent turns. Failure or cancellation returns a structured
`CompactionResult` and leaves history unchanged. Repeated compaction passes the
previous Summary to the Compactor for merging and replaces the old Summary
message.

`CompactionStarted`, `CompactionCompleted`, and `CompactionFailed` expose the
lifecycle. `abort()` and `wait_for_idle()` apply to compaction as well as normal
runs. `SessionRecorder` stores a compacted recovery snapshot while retaining
the original `SessionMessage` audit entries. Each operation exposes a stable
`operation_id` and `CompactionTrigger`. The Core does not choose a summary model
or prompt.

## Durable Session journals

`SessionRecorder` can use `JsonlSessionStorage` to append a versioned semantic
record for each accepted lifecycle mutation:

```python
from simagentplg import JsonlSessionStorage, SessionRecorder

storage = JsonlSessionStorage("./sessions")
recorder = SessionRecorder(session_id="project-42", storage=storage)
agent = BaseAgent(model, agent_id="core-agent", event_sink=recorder)
await agent.run(task="remember this decision")
```

A different process can load the completed snapshot and explicitly restore a
new Agent:

```python
saved = await storage.load("project-42")
if saved is not None:
    resumed = BaseAgent(model, agent_id="core-agent", event_sink=recorder)
    resumed.restore_session(saved)
```

Each JSONL record carries a monotonic `revision`, immutable `record_id`,
`parent_id`, and `branch_id`. Version 1 projects only the `main` branch, but the
envelope is already tree-addressable so future Fork support will not require a
file-format migration. `SessionRecorder` appends compact mutations such as
`run_started`, `message_appended`, `compaction_applied`, and `run_finished`;
explicit `save()` appends a full Checkpoint for imports and exports.

Session IDs are mapped to hashed filenames. Each complete line is encoded
before one append write and followed by `fsync`; an incomplete final line from
an interrupted write is ignored and repaired before the next append. Invalid
JSON in a completed line and unsupported journal schema versions raise
`SessionSerializationError` instead of looking like a missing Session.

`restore_session()` verifies Agent identity and rejects unfinished Runs. Core
does not replay an interrupted Tool call because it may already have produced
an external side effect. Separate processes may read completed snapshots, but
concurrent writers to the same Session are not yet coordinated in this
file-backed implementation.

## Runtime policy

Tool availability and completion policy are independent:

```python
from simagentplg import RuntimePolicy

policy = RuntimePolicy(
    max_steps=20,
    max_no_tool_responses=3,
    max_repeated_tool_calls=3,
    max_run_tokens=None,
    require_explicit_finish=False,
)
```

`max_run_tokens` is an optional cumulative model-request budget. It is checked
between turns: the current response and its requested tools settle first, then
the guard prevents another Provider request with
`StopReason.TOKEN_BUDGET_EXCEEDED`. If another request is needed but Usage was
not reported, the run stops with `StopReason.USAGE_UNAVAILABLE` instead of
treating unknown Usage as zero.

By default, an agent may call tools and later complete with ordinary text. A
derived autonomous agent can require a completion tool:

```python
policy = RuntimePolicy(require_explicit_finish=True)
```

That agent must register one of its own tools that returns
`ToolControl.COMPLETE`.

## Custom tools

Tools are grouped into handlers. `MethodToolHandler` maps a tool named `add` to
an async `do_add()` method:

```python
from collections.abc import Mapping
from typing import Any

from simagentplg import CancellationToken, MethodToolHandler, StepOutcome

ADD_TOOL = {
    "type": "function",
    "function": {
        "name": "add",
        "description": "Add two numbers.",
        "parameters": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
                "left": {"type": "number"},
                "right": {"type": "number"},
            },
            "required": ["left", "right"],
        },
    },
}


class MathHandler(MethodToolHandler):
    def __init__(self) -> None:
        super().__init__((ADD_TOOL,))

    async def do_add(
        self,
        arguments: Mapping[str, Any],
        *,
        cancellation: CancellationToken | None = None,
    ) -> StepOutcome:
        return StepOutcome(
            {"value": arguments["left"] + arguments["right"]}
        )
```

Register it explicitly:

```python
agent = BaseAgent(
    OpenAIModelAdapter(ModelConfig.from_env()),
    agent_id="calculator",
    handlers=[MathHandler()],
)
```

Duplicate tool names fail during startup instead of being silently
overwritten.

### Tool progress

Long-running tools can optionally accept a scoped `progress` reporter. Existing
`do_*` methods that do not declare this keyword remain compatible:

```python
from simagentplg import ToolProgressReporter, ToolProgressUpdate


async def do_index(
    self,
    arguments,
    *,
    cancellation,
    progress: ToolProgressReporter | None = None,
) -> StepOutcome:
    if progress is not None:
        await progress.report(
            ToolProgressUpdate(
                "indexing files",
                {"completed": 12, "total": 40},
            )
        )
    return StepOutcome({"indexed": 40})
```

Each accepted update becomes a `ToolProgressed` event correlated with the
current run, turn, and tool call. Updates are ordered, stop after cancellation,
and are ignored after `ToolCompleted`. They never change `StepOutcome` or
`ToolControl`, and are not persisted to Agent state or Session.

### Tool control signals

Tool payload and runtime control are separate:

```python
from simagentplg import StepOutcome, ToolControl

StepOutcome(data)  # continue the provider-tool loop
StepOutcome(data, control=ToolControl.COMPLETE)
StepOutcome(data, control=ToolControl.REJECT)
StepOutcome(data, control=ToolControl.CANCEL)
```

This lets the runtime distinguish successful completion, policy rejection,
and tool-requested cancellation. `ToolControl.CANCEL` is a tool's business
decision; external `agent.abort()` uses the separate run cancellation
protocol.

## Tool middleware

`ToolMiddleware` decorates a tool execution without owning concrete tool
policy:

```python
from simagentplg import ToolMiddleware


class AuditMiddleware(ToolMiddleware):
    async def __call__(self, context, call_next):
        print("before", context.tool_name)
        result = await call_next(context)
        print("after", context.tool_name)
        return result
```

Approval UI and shell-specific risk policies should be implemented by the
derived agent, not by the core.

## MCP tools

MCP uses the same handler contract:

```python
from simagentplg import (
    BaseAgent,
    McpToolHandler,
    ModelConfig,
    OpenAIModelAdapter,
)

agent = BaseAgent(
    OpenAIModelAdapter(ModelConfig.from_env()),
    agent_id="browser",
    handlers=[McpToolHandler("examples/mcp_config.json")],
)
```

An MCP-enabled agent can execute MCP tools and then complete with plain text.
It does not need a separate finish tool unless its `RuntimePolicy` explicitly
requires one.

## Skills

Skills are prompt and resource extensions independent of handler tools:

```python
from pathlib import Path

from simagentplg import BaseAgent, ModelConfig, OpenAIModelAdapter

agent = BaseAgent(
    OpenAIModelAdapter(ModelConfig.from_env()),
    agent_id="skilled-agent",
    skills_dir=Path("examples/skills"),
)
```

`SkillManager` discovers child folders containing `SKILL.md` and injects compact
metadata containing each skill's name, description, and file location. Users
can explicitly select a skill with `$skill_name` or `skill:skill_name`, which
injects its full instructions into the current context. The core does not
register a special skill tool; a derived agent with a file-reading tool can use
the advertised location for progressive loading.

```text
examples/skills/
  release_notes/
    SKILL.md
    template.md
    examples/
      sample.md
```

## Core boundary

SimAgentPlg core owns mechanisms:

```text
Orchestration + State + Context + Runtime Policy + Run Result
+ Model Adapter + Tool Protocol + Middleware + MCP + Skills
+ Lifecycle Events + Linear Session + Runtime Cancellation
+ Provider Streaming + Tool Progress + Usage Accounting + Run Budget
+ Context Pressure + Compaction Preparation
+ Model Compactor + Summary Entry + Durable Session Snapshot
```

Derived agents own concrete capabilities and policies:

```text
Shell + Filesystem + Git + Workspace + Approval UI
+ Sandbox + Completion Tool + Product Interface
```
